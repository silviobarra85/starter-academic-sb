abstract: The CHAMPIONS 25 workshop explores the intersection of data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-centered technologies in the domain of sports, with a specific focus on football. As data-driven decision-making becomes increasingly central to modern football tactics, performance evaluation, and strategic preparation, this workshop aims to examine how digital tools, AI-powered systems, and interactive interfaces can support players, coaches, analysts, and other stakeholders in the sports ecosystem.
The event will feature contributions on machine learning techniques for performance analytics, predictive modeling for game scenarios, and innovative interfaces for sports professionals. A keynote speech by Adriano Bacconi, internationally renowned football analyst and CEO of Math&Sport, will address the vital role of data in the modern game and its power to enhance training efficiency, tactical awareness, and situational foresight. The workshop will also present Kickteck, a chatbot developed by Math&Sport that improves the user experience of coaches and analysts by making data insights more accessible and actionable.
CHAMPIONS 25 brings together researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders to explore how AI and data technologies can transform sports analysis into a more interactive, insightful, and predictive practice, ultimately contributing to smarter, more engaging, and data-informed football.
