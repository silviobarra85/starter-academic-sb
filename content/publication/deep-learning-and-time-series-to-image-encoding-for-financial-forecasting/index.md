abstract: In the last decade, market financial forecasting has attracted high
  interests amongst the researchers in pattern recognition. Usually, the data
  used for analysing the market, and then gamble on its future trend, are
  provided as time series; this aspect, along with the high fluctuation of this
  kind of data, cuts out the use of very efficient classification tools, very
  popular in the state of the art, like the well known convolutional neural
  networks ( CNNs ) models such as Inception, ResNet, AlexNet, and so on. This
  forces the researchers to train new tools from scratch. Such operations could
  be very time consuming. This paper exploits an ensemble of CNNs, trained over
  Gramian angular fields ( GAF ) images, generated from time series related to
  the Standard - Poor's 500 index future; the aim is the prediction of the
  future trend of the U.S. market. A multi-resolution imaging approach is used
  to feed each CNN, enabling the analysis of different time intervals for a
  single observation. A simple trading system based on the ensemble forecaster
  is used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approach. Our method
  outperforms the buy-And-hold ( B - H ) strategy in a time frame where the
  latter provides excellent returns. Both quantitative and qualitative results
  are provided.
