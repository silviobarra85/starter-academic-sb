abstract: "The iris segmentation step is usually the most time consuming stage
  of biometric systems when dealing with non ideal conditions, which produce
  diverse noise factors during the acquisition. On the other side, it also
  represents a crucial step since poor removal of noise leads to degradation of
  recognition performance. In this work, a lightweight fuzzy-based solution has
  been explored. The goal is to propose a fast but reliable segmentation
  approach which preserves the original resolution of the iris images. The
  preliminary results obtained on a subset of MICHE dataset, confirmed both
  acceptable performance in terms of time consumption and good quality of
  segmentation mask suitable for matching purposes. "
