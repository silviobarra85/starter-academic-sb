abstract: "The worldwide diffusion of latest generations mobile devices, namely
  smartphones and tablets, represents the technological premise to a new wave of
  applications for which reliable owner identification is becoming a key
  requirement. This crucial task can be approached by means of biometrics (face,
  iris or fingerprint) by exploiting high resolution imaging sensors typically
  built-in on this class of devices, possibly resulting in a ubiquitous platform
  to verify owner identity during any kind of transaction involving the exchange
  of sensible data. Among the aforementioned biometrics, iris is known for its
  inherent invariance and accuracy, though only a few works have explored this
  topic on mobile devices. In this paper a comprehensive method for iris
  authentication on mobiles by means of spatial histograms is described. The
  proposed approach has been tested on the MICHE-I iris dataset, featuring
  subjects captured indoor and outdoor under controlled and uncontrolled
  conditions by means of built-in cameras aboard three among the most diffused
  smartphones/tablets on the market. The experimental results collected, provide
  an interesting insight about the readiness of mobile technology with regard to
  iris recognition. "
