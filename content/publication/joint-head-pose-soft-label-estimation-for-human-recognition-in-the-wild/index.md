abstract: Soft biometrics have been emerging to complement other traits and are
  particularly useful for poor quality data. In this paper, we propose an
  efficient algorithm to estimate human head poses and to infer soft biometric
  labels based on the 3D morphology of the human head. Starting by considering a
  set of pose hypotheses, we use a learning set of head shapes synthesized from
  anthropometric surveys to derive a set of 3D head centroids that constitutes a
  metric space. Next, representing queries by sets of 2D head landmarks, we use
  projective geometry techniques to rank efficiently the joint 3D head
  centroids/pose hypotheses according to their likelihood of matching each
  query. The rationale is that the most likely hypotheses are sufficiently close
  to the query, so a good solution can be found by convex energy minimization
  techniques. Once a solution has been found, the 3D head centroid and the query
  are assumed to have similar morphology, yielding the soft label. Our
  experiments point toward the usefulness of the proposed solution, which can
  improve the effectiveness of face recognizers and can also be used as a
  privacy-preserving solution for biometric recognition in public environments.
