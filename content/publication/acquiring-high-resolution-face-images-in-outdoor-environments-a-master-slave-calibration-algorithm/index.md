abstract: "Facial recognition at-a-distance in surveillance scenarios remains an
  open problem, particularly due to the small number of pixels representing the
  facial region. The use of pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras has been advocated to
  solve this problem, however, the existing approaches either rely on rough
  approximations or additional constraints to estimate the mapping between image
  coordinates and pan-tilt parameters. In this paper, we aim at extending
  PTZ-assisted facial recognition to surveillance scenarios by proposing a
  master-slave calibration algorithm capable of accurately estimating pan-tilt
  parameters without depending on additional constraints. Our approach exploits
  geometric cues to automatically estimate subjects height and thus determine
  their 3D position. Experimental results show that the presented algorithm is
  able to acquire high-resolution face images at a distance ranging from 5 to 40
  meters with high success rate. Additionally, we certify the applicability of
  the aforementioned algorithm to biometric recognition through a face
  recognition test, comprising 20 probe subjects and 13,020 gallery subjects. "
