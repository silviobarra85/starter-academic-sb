abstract: Interest in the security of individuals has increased in recent years.
  This increase has in turn led to much wider deployment of surveillance cameras
  worldwide, and consequently, automated surveillance systems research has
  received more attention from the scientific community than before.
  Concurrently, biometrics research has become more popular as well, and it is
  supported by the increasing number of approaches devised to address specific
  degradation factors of unconstrained environments. Despite these recent
  efforts, no automated surveillance system that performs reliable biometric
  recognition in such an environment has become available. Nevertheless, recent
  developments in human motion analysis and biometric recognition suggest that
  both can be combined to develop a fully automated system. As such, this paper
  reviews recent advances in both areas, with a special focus on surveillance
  scenarios. When compared to previous studies, we highlight two distinct
  features, i.e., (1) our emphasis is on approaches that are devised to work in
  unconstrained environments and surveillance scenarios; and (2) biometric
  recognition is the final goal of the surveillance system, as opposed to
  behavior analysis, anomaly detection or action recognition.
