abstract: In recent years, the concept of smart cities has garnered increasing attention as urban areas grapple with the challenges of population growth, resource management, and infrastructure optimization. Smart cities leverage innovative technologies to enhance the quality of life of their residents, promote sustainability, and improve the efficiency of urban systems [1,2]. Central to the realization of smart city initiatives are advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) [3,4] and the Internet of Things (IoT) [5–7], which offer unprecedented opportunities for data-driven decision making, automation, and real-time monitoring.
