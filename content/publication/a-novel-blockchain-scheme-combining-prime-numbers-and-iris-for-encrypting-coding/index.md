abstract: This paper presents a novel technique to build an access key that
  finds its natural fit in blockchain, smart cities environments, transactions
  of electronic currencies and, as proved by NIST tests, in high computer
  security scenarios where having a high level of secrecy is mandatory;
  furthermore, the key building procedure employs a biometric component to
  guarantee, with a reasonable level of certainty, the user identity. These
  characteristics are obtained by using an asymmetric cryptography algorithm
  (RSA) and Iris biometrics; both of them, taken singularly, exhibit some limits
  that can be overcome by joining the two approaches through Information Fusion
  (IF) techniques. In the follows, it will be presented the developed algorithm
  named Iris Information Fusion (IIF) that fuses a biometric component
  represented by the iris with a numerical component, in this case the product
  of two prime numbers which is the module of RSA algorithm.
