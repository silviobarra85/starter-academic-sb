abstract: Notwithstanding the enhancement obtained in the last decade
  researches, the recognition of facial attributes is still today a trend.
  Besides the mere face recognition, the singular face features, like mouth,
  nose and hair, are considered as soft biometrics; these can be useful for
  human identification in cases the face is partially occluded, and only some
  regions are visible. In this paper we propose a model generated by transfer
  learning approach for the recognition of the face attributes. Also, an
  unsupervised clustering model is described, which is in charge of dividing and
  grouping faces based on their characteristics. Furthermore, we show how
  clusters can be evaluated by a compact summary of them, and how Deep Learning
  models should be properly trained for attribute prediction tasks.
