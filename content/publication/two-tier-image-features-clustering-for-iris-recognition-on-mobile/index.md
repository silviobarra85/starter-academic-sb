abstract: "Nowadays, many smartphones are provided with built-in sensors for the
  acquisition and the recognition of specific biometric traits of the user. This
  policy has been adopted since the massive use of such devices brought the user
  to store sensible data in them as well as effectuate sensitive transactions
  on-the-move. As a consequence, many biometric systems have been migrated from
  stand alone to mobile environments. The methodology proposed in the following
  presents an approach to the iris recognition in visible spectrum. Iris images
  are first enhanced by a fuzzy color/contrast preserving technique and then
  passed to a two-tier clustering: the first is based on the linear
  decomposition of the iris into superpixels; the second one exploits an
  unsupervised learning network model to built a feature vector of the iris.
  According to the performance obtained in terms of time and recognition rate,
  the method is compliant with the needs of real-time and in-movement
  environments."
