abstract: "People struggle every day with authentication to access a protected
  service or location, or simply aimed at protecting one’s own devices. This
  spurs a growing demand for self-handled authentication strategies. The
  increasing number of remote services of various kinds corresponds to an
  increasing number of passwords to use and remember, and also to the growth of
  the password theft risk, due to the increasing value of the protected
  resources. The other core element in present authentication scenarios is the
  ubiquity of mobile equipment. Smartphones add a “whatever” dimension to the
  possible uses of the mobile devices whenever and wherever that include
  storing/transferring multimedia information, often personal and often
  sensitive. Biometrics can both enforce and simplify authentication in
  controlled environments. Mobile biometrics in uncontrolled settings, where
  there is no operator to guide the capture of a “good-quality” sample on a
  mobile device, is the new frontier for secure use of data and services. The
  iris is among the best candidates for biometric recognition. It is extremely
  discriminative: Right and left irises of the same person are so different to
  hinder a correct matching, because randotypic elements largely overcome
  genotypic ones in individual development. However, self-acquired samples often
  suffer from poor quality, due, e.g., to reflections, motion blurring, out of
  focus, or bad image framing. Mobile setting and especially the inherent
  problems related to uncontrolled iris image acquisition are addressed in the
  two challenges of the MICHE project, whose results are the core topic of this
  chapter."
