abstract: In the last fifteen years, smartphones have become very popular
  amongst the population, with the subsequent development of dozens of
  applications aimed at providing security to these portable devices. Nowadays,
  the cutting edge devices are also provided with biometric sensors (e.g.,
  fingerprint sensors) allowing the users to access them without using the
  out-of-date alphanumerical password. In this work, we present a method that
  realizes iris recognition by means of Self Organizing Maps (SOM). In order to
  obtain a better refined and discriminative feature map, the RGB data of the
  iris, previously segmented, have been combined with two statistical
  descriptors. The algorithm has been designed specifically to require a low
  processing power, making it an ideal choice in the context of mobile devices.
