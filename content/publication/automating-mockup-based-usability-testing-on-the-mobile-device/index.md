abstract: User interface usability is a very relevant aspect, especially for
  mobile applications. In this paper we propose a methodology for automating
  user interface usability testing in the early phases of the development
  process directly on the mobile device. Mockup interfaces are designed, then
  the way the designer interacts with the interface is compared with the way the
  end-user interacts with the same interface and the discrepancies between the
  two usage models are highlighted. The methodology is supported by a mobile
  tool named PlatoS, which captures a case of use of a mockup in terms of a
  sequence of actions. On the end-user side, PlatoS captures the user
  interaction with the mockups and performs the automatic identification of
  usability problems on the base of the log data. An example of evaluation of an
  eCommerce mobile prototypes is also presented.
