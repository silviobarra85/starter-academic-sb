abstract: The analysis of the shape and geometry of the human hand has long
  represented an attractive field of research to address the needs of digital
  image forensics. Over recent years, it has also turned out to be effective in
  biometrics, where several innovative research lines are pursued. Given the
  widespread diffusion of mobile and portable devices, the possibility of
  checking the owner identity and controlling the access to the device by the
  hand image looks particularly attractive and less intrusive than other
  biometric traits. This encourages new research to tacklethe present
  limitations. The proposed work implements the complete architecture of a
  mobile hand recognition system, which uses the camera of the mobile device for
  the acquisition of the hand in visible light spectrum. The segmentation of the
  hand starts from the detection of the convexities and concavities defined by
  the fingers, and allows extracting 57 different features from the hand shape.
  The main contributions of the paper develop along two directions. First,
  dimensionality reduction methods are investigated, in order to identify
  subsets of features including only the most discriminating and robust ones.
  Second, different matching strategies are compared. The proposed method is
  tested over a dataset of hands from 100 subjects. The best obtained Equal
  Error Rate is 0.52%. Results demonstrate that discarding features that are
  more prone to distortions allows lighter processing, but also produces better
  performance than using the full set of features. This confirms the feasibility
  of such an approach on mobile devices, and further suggests to adopt it even
  in more traditional settings.
