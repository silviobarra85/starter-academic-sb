abstract: "The use of mobile devices is continuously growing, together with
  their ability to store and exchange sensitive data. This has spurred the
  interest, from one side, in exploiting their apparent vulnerabilities, and on
  the other side, in protecting users from any malfeasance. In this scenario, it
  has become essential to develop and deploy secure access and identification
  protocols on mobile platforms. Another emerging aspect that also needs
  attention bears on the commercial and social use of identity management
  systems. Towards such ends, this paper proposes using biometrics as the
  technology of choice, and describes FAME (Face Authentication for Mobile
  Encounters). FAME is an embedded application for mobile devices that provides
  both verification and identification, including identity management to support
  social activities, e.g., finding doubles in a social network. Such
  functionalities are implemented subject to privacy and security concerns. FAME
  cascade architecture is modular. The single modules perform image acquisition,
  anti-spoofing, face detection, face segmentation, feature extraction, and face
  matching. FAME also provides continuous recognition and best biometric sample
  selection, that both accommodate varying pose and illumination. All procedures
  are optimized for mobile use, using low-demanding and computation-light
  algorithms. Preliminary questionnaires administered to users engaged with
  using FAME show user acceptance, ease of use, and reliability. "
