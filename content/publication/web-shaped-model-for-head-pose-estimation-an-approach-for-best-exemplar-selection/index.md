doi: "Head pose estimation is a sensitive topic in video surveillance/smart
  ambient scenarios since head rotations can hide/distort discriminative
  features of the face. Face recognition would often tackle the problem of video
  frames where subjects appear in poses making it quite impossible. In this
  respect, the selection of the frames with the best face orientation can allow
  triggering recognition only on these, therefore decreasing the possibility of
  errors. This paper proposes a novel approach to head pose estimation for smart
  cities and video surveillance scenarios, aiming at this goal. The method
  relies on a cascade of two models: the first one predicts the positions of 68
  well-known face landmarks; the second one applies a web-shaped model over the
  detected landmarks, to associate each of them to a specific face sector. The
  method can work on detected faces at a reasonable distance and with a
  resolution that is supported by several present devices. Results of
  experiments executed over some classical pose estimation benchmarks, namely
  Point '04, Biwi, and AFLW datasets show good performance in terms of both pose
  estimation and computing time. Further results refer to noisy images that are
  typical of the addressed settings. Finally, examples demonstrate the selection
  of the best frames from videos captured in video surveillance conditions."
