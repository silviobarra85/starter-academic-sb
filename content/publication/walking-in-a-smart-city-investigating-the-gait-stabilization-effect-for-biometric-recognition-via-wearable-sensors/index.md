abstract: "Technology is expected to enhance life in a Smart City: everything is
  intelligent, digital, interconnected, and inclusive. In addition, all everyday
  activities are facilitated. This paper presents a biometric authentication
  strategy based on gait dynamics. The produced signals are acquired by the
  common mobile device accelerometers (especially those embedded in
  smartphones). The user has nothing to do but normally approach a controlled
  entry: authentication is automatically triggered by ambient elements
  (beacons). This transparent protocol entails user awareness of the
  authentication since the user has to install a suitable app, therefore it does
  not cause any covert privacy violation. In addition, it allows avoiding any
  explicit, possibly cumbersome authentication procedure. Last but not least,
  the use of a sensor directly embedded in everyday usersâ€™ equipment supports an
  efficient approach without the need for further hardware."
