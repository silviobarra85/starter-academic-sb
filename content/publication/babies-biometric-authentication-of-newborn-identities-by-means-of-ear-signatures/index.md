abstract: Many research studies demonstrated that recognition based on ear
  biometrics offers an accuracy which is comparable to face trait, especially in
  controlled settings. Our proposal is to exploit it to avoid the problem of
  newborn swap, which is possible and actually happens, most of all in crowded
  maternity wards of big hospitals. We tested the viability of this solution
  using a dataset of ear images of newborns, and the obtained results testify
  that it is possible to decrease the probability of an error using this
  technique.
