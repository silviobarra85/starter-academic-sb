abstract: In the present paper, we propose a source camera identification (SCI)
  method for mobile devices based on deep learning. Recently, convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) have shown a remarkable performance on several tasks
  such as image recognition, video analysis or natural language processing. A
  CNN consists on a set of layers where each layer is composed by a set of high
  pass filters which are applied all over the input image. This convolution
  process provides the unique ability to extract features automatically from
  data and to learn from those features. Our proposal describes a CNN
  architecture which is able to infer the noise pattern of mobile camera sensors
  (also known as camera fingerprint) with the aim at detecting and identifying
  not only the mobile device used to capture an image (with a 98% of accuracy),
  but also from which embedded camera the image was captured. More specifically,
  we provide an extensive analysis on the proposed architecture considering
  different configurations. The experiment has been carried out using the images
  captured from different mobile device cameras (MICHE-I Dataset) and the
  obtained results have proved the robustness of the proposed method.
