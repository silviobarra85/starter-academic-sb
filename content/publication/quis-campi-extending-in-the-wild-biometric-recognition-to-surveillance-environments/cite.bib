abstract="Efforts in biometrics are being held into extending robust recognition techniques to in the wild scenarios. Nonetheless, and despite being a very attractive goal, human identification in the surveillance context remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biometric system -- Quis-Campi -- that effectively bridges the gap between surveillance and biometric recognition while having a minimum amount of operational restrictions. We propose a fully automated surveillance system for human recognition purposes, attained by combining human detection and tracking, further enhanced by a PTZ camera that delivers data with enough quality to perform biometric recognition. Along with the system concept, implementation details for both hardware and software modules are provided, as well as preliminary results over a real scenario.",
