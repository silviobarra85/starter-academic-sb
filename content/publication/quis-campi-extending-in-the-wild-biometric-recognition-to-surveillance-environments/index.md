abstract: Efforts in biometrics are being held into extending robust recognition
  techniques to in the wild scenarios. Nonetheless, and despite being a very
  attractive goal, human identification in the surveillance context remains an
  open problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biometric system –
  Quis-Campi – that effectively bridges the gap between surveillance and
  biometric recognition while having a minimum amount of operational
  restrictions.We propose a fully automated surveillance system for human
  recognition purposes, attained by combining human detection and tracking,
  further enhanced by a PTZ camera that delivers data with enough quality to
  perform biometric recognition. Along with the system concept, implementation
  details for both hardware and software modules are provided, as well as
  preliminary results over a real scenario.
