abstract: Once confined to indoor biometric applications depending on dedicated
  acquisition devices, recently the iris has proved to be a suitable biometric
  for in-the-wild ubiquitous person authentication, thanks to continuously
  improving image capturing/processing performances provided by last generations
  of smartphones. In this mobile context, the efficiency of the whole processing
  pipeline represents a crucial aspect of any practical application and the
  segmentation task, that is deeply affected by noisy iris images may become a
  serious bottleneck. This work presents F-FID, an effective and time-wise
  efficient approach to de-noising of iris images by means of a fuzzy controller
  without sacrificing their resolution and saliency. The experiments,
  specifically conducted on the MICHE dataset, confirm that the proposed method
  provides segmentation accuracy comparable to that achieved by state of the art
  algorithms, while requiring less than twenty percent of their average
  computing time.
