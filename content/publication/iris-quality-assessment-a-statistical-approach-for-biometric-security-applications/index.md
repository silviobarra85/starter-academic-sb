abstract: Biometric recognition is often affected by low quality images. This is
  especially true in iris recognition fields, due to the fact that the area of
  the iris is quite small and wrong detection are very common when standard iris
  detection methods are used, like the Hough transform. In this paper, the iris
  quality assessment of over 1200 images is achieved, from three different
  datasets. The evaluation of the iris is done by using shallow learning
  techniques. Two different experiments have been carried out and the results
  obtained show good accuracy performance on the test sets.
