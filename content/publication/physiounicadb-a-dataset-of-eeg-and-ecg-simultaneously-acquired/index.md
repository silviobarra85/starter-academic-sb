abstract: "Most of the application involving the study of EEG
  (Electroencephalogram) and ECG (Electrocardiogram) are focused on their
  usefulness from a medical point of view. In the last decade, these signals
  have been extensively studied also from other perspectives, like biometric
  recognition, sleep disorder analysis and brain computer interface
  applications. Although many datasets are publicly available, none of them
  gathers both EEG and ECG signal simultaneously. This lack carries the
  researchers to look for some workaround for analyzing aspects such as the
  removal of artifacts from the EEG or the data fusion of EEG and ECG. In the
  following work the dataset PhysioUnicaDB is presented; it consists of 22
  acquisition from healthy subjects, in which the EEG and ECG signals are
  simultaneously acquired. The data are not filtered, so leaving the data as raw
  as possible. "
