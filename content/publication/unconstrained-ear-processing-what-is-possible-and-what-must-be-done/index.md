abstract: "Ear biometrics, compared with other physical traits, presents both
  advantages and limits. First of all, the small surface and the quite simple
  structure play a controversial role. On the positive side, they allow faster
  processing than, say, face recognition, as well as less complex recognition
  strategies than, say, fingerprints. On the negative side, the small ear area
  itself makes recognition systems especially sensitive to occlusions. Moreover,
  the prominent 3D structure of distinctive elements like the pinna and the lobe
  makes the same systems sensible to changes in illumination and viewpoint.
  Overall, the best accuracy results are still achieved in conditions that are
  significantly more favorable than those found in typical (really) uncontrolled
  settings. This makes the use of this biometrics in real world applications
  still difficult to propose, since a commercial use requires a much higher
  robustness. Notwithstanding the mentioned limits, ear is still an attractive
  topic for biometrics research, due to other positive aspects. In particular,
  it is quite easy to acquire ear images remotely, and these anatomic features
  are also relatively stable in size and structure along time. Of course, as any
  other biometric trait, they also call for some template updating. This is
  mainly due to age, but not in the commonly assumed way. The apparent bigger
  size of elders' ears with respect to those of younger subjects, is due to the
  fact that aging causes a relaxation of the skin and of some muscle-fibrous
  structures that hold the so called pinna, i.e. the most evident anatomical
  element of the ear. This creates the belief that ears continue growing all
  life long. On the other hand, a similar process holds for the nose, for which
  the relaxation of the cartilage tissue tends to cause a curvature downwards.
  In this chapter we will present a survey of present techniques for ear
  recognition, from geometrical to 2D-3D multimodal, and will attempt a
  reasonable hypothesis about the future ability of ear biometrics to fulfill
  the requirements of less controlled/covert data acquisition frameworks. "
