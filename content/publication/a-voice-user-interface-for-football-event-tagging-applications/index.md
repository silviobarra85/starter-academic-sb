abstract: Manual event tagging may be a very long and stressful activity, due
  the monotonous operations involved. This is particularly true when dealing
  with online video tagging, as for football matches, in which the burden of
  events to tag can consist of many thousands of actions, according to the
  desired level of granularity. In this work we describe an actual solution,
  developed for an existing football match tagging application, in which the GUI
  has been enhanced and integrated with a Voice User Interface, aiming at
  reducing tagging time and error rate. Empirical tests have revealed the
  efficiency and the benefits brought by the developed solution.
