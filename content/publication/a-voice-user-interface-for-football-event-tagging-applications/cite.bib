This is particularly true when dealing with online video tagging, as for football matches, in which the burden of events to tag can consist of many thousands of actions, according to the desired level of granularity. In this work we describe an actual solution, developed for an existing football match tagging application, in which the GUI has been enhanced and integrated with a Voice User Interface, aiming at reducing tagging time and error rate. Empirical tests have revealed the efficiency and the benefits brought by the developed solution.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces}, articleno = {75}, numpages = {3}, keywords = {Integrated Voice User Interface, Online Video Tagging, Match tagging}, location = {Salerno, Italy}, series = {AVI '20} }
