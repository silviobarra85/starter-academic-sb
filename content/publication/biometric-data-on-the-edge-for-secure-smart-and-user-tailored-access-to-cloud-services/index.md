abstract: We are living an era in which each of us is immersed in a fully
  connected environment. The smart devices worn everyday by everyone let the
  users be projected into the so called IoT world, whose main aim is to provide
  tools and strategies to solve problems of everyday life as well as to improve
  well-being and quality of life. Such a goal can be achieved in several ways,
  but consumer specific services should be provided according to their daily
  habits, as well as temporary needs. This can be made possible by current
  mobile devices and their built-in sensors, which can infer the context where
  the owner operates and the performed activities to build up a user profile. In
  this work, an architecture for cloud services supply is proposed, based on
  subject continuous authentication and context (status/activity) recognition. A
  subject and the context are authenticated/recognised by means of the cyclic
  recognition of signals captured by the sensors of his/her smartphone, e.g.,
  accelerometer and gyroscope. In order to test the accuracy of the proposed
  context recognition, the H-MOG dataset has been used, which provides joint
  acquisitions of status data (Sitting or Walking) related to the activity
  performed (Reading, Writing, or Navigating Map)
