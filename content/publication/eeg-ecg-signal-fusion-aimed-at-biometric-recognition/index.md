abstract: The recognition of individuals based on behavioral and biological
  characteristics has made important strides over the past few years. Growing
  interest has been recently devoted to the study of physiological measures,
  which include the electrical activity of brain (EEG) and heart (ECG). Even if
  the use of multimodal approaches overcome several limitations of traditional
  uni-modal biometric systems, the simultaneous use of EEG and ECG
  characteristics has been scarcely investigated. In this paper, we present a
  set of preliminary results derived by the investigation of a biometric system
  based on the fusion of simple features simultaneously extracted from EEG and
  ECG signals. The reported results show high performance both from uni-modal
  approach (higher performance being EER = 11.17 and EER = 3.83 for EEG and ECG
  respectively) and fusion (EER = 2.94). However, caution should be considered
  in the interpretation of the reported results mainly beacuse the analysis was
  performed on a limited set of subjects.
