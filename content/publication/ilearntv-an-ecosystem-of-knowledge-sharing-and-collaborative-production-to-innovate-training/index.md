abstract: Knowledge sharing and collaborative production are two essential el-
  ements for transforming the current learning ecosystems into engines of social
  and territorial innovation. In response to the growing need for instructors'
  skills upgrading in this direction, iLearnTV aims to re-design the traditional
  paradigms and methods for instructors' life-long training by integrating
  modern technologies in the loop. To this end, it is offering a
  software-as-a-service learning content management system that makes it
  possible to collaboratively arrange, combine, and publish multi-format
  learning content on laptops, tablets and smartphones. Educational material is
  indexed inside a digital repository and made available to users for re-use,
  while predefined and customizable templates support collabora- tive creation
  of multi-format educational material based on them. The underlying cloud
  infrastructure is responsible of managing the required hardware resources,
  while the software layer on top of it provides interfaces and applicative
  functions to end users. The production-delivering process, together with the
  models to be applied, the content management practices, the professional roles
  and the corre- sponding competences, are redefined in order to meet the needs
  of modern learn- ing ecosystems. With iLearnTV, we expect to support
  instructors in dealing with the current technological changes in education and
  making their teaching effec- tive towards digital natives, enhancing both the
  human and the technological dimensions within school communities in an
  ecosystemic perspective.
