abstract: "Physiological measures are widely studied from a medical point of
  view. Most applications lie in the field of diagnosis of heart attacks, as
  regards the ECG, or the detection of epileptic events, in the case of the EEG.
  In the last ten years, these signals are being investigated also from a
  biometric point of view, in order to exploit the discriminative capability
  provided by these measures in recognizing individuals. The present work
  proposes a multimodal biometric recognition system based on the fusion of the
  first lead (i) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) with six different bands of the
  electroencephalogram (EEG). The proposed approach is based on the extraction
  of fiducial features (peaks) from the ECG combined with spectrum features of
  the EEG. A dataset has been created, by composing the signals of two
  well-known databases. The results, reported by means of EER values, AUC values
  and ROC curves, show good recognition performances. "
