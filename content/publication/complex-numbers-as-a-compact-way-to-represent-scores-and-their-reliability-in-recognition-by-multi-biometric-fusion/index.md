abstract: "Multi-biometric systems are a powerful solution to deal with
  limitations of single classifiers, therefore improving the final recognition
  accuracy. The sub-systems composing the final architecture often return
  supplementary indices of input quality and/or of response reliability, which
  further qualify each recognition score. These indices can enter different
  information fusion policies. First, they can be used as weights for the fusion
  of the corresponding scores, in such a way that less trustworthy responses
  have a lower influence. Alternatively, they can be used to drive the selection
  of a subset of systems actually enabled for each fusion operation. The present
  work discusses their appropriate combination with respective scores, to obtain
  single values which are easier to handle and compare. It is worth underlining
  the different nature of quality and reliability measures. The quality
  estimation of input samples requires a complex analysis of environmental
  conditions, including capture sensors, besides computations over acquired
  data. Reliability of a system estimates its ability to return a correct
  response. As an alternative to combination, some solutions rather estimate the
  joint distributions of conditional probabilities of the scores from the single
  subsystems. These solutions require training through a huge number of samples.
  Furthermore, they assume stable score distributions. Our unified
  representation of the recognition score and of the corresponding
  quality/reliability value into a single complex number provides simplification
  and speed up of fusion of multi-classifier results. It also allows to devise
  procedures to readily compare the performance of different modules in a
  multibiometric system, given that there is no natural ordering of these pairs
  of values of different nature. Moreover our method achieves performance
  comparable to top performing schemes, yet does not require a prior estimation
  of (joint) score distributions. As a matter of fact, though representing an
  upper bound to the obtainable performance, Likelihood ratio has the limit to
  require an accurate estimation of score distributions, while our approach
  relies on the reliability of each single response. This feature is very
  interesting when the set of relevant subjects may present significant
  variations over time. "
