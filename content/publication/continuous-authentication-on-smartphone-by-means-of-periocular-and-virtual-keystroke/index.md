abstract: "Nowadays, biometric recognition and verification methods are
  everywhere, trying to face the security issues that constantly affect our
  digital-every day life. In addition, many special-purpose applications, also
  need a constant (continuous) verification of the user in order to avoid that a
  sensitive operation is executed by an impostor; as an example let think to
  banking operations. In this paper, a continuous authentication method on
  mobile device is presented, which uses smartphone gestures data for the
  constant verification of the user and periocular data for a second step
  verification module. The results executed over two datasets show a
  verification accuracy of 83% and 94% approximately, respectively for
  smartphone touch features and periocular data. "
