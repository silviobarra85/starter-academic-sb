abstract: "The increasing popularity of smartphones amongst the population laid
  the basis for a wide range of applications aimed at security and privacy
  protection. Very modern mobile devices have recently demonstrated the
  feasibility of using a camera sensor to access the system without typing any
  alphanumerical password. In this work, we present a method that implements
  iris recognition in the visible spectrum through unsupervised learning by
  means of Self Organizing Maps (SOM). The proposed method uses a SOM network to
  cluster iris features at pixel level. The discriminative feature map is
  obtained by using RGB data of the iris combined with the statistical
  descriptors of kurtosis and skewness. An experimental analysis on MICHE-I and
  UBIRISv1 datasets demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm,
  which has been specifically designed to require low processing power in
  compliance with the limited capability of common mobile devices. "
