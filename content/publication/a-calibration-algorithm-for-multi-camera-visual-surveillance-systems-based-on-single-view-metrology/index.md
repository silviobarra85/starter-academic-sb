abstract: The growing concerns about persons security and the increasing
  popularity of pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, have been raising the interest on
  automated master-slave surveillance systems. Such systems are typically
  composed by (1) a fixed wide-angle camera that covers a large area, detects
  and tracks moving objects in the scene; and (2) a PTZ camera, that provides a
  close-up view of an object of interest. Previously published approaches
  attempted to establish 2D correspondences between the video streams of both
  cameras, which is a ill-posed formulation due to the absence of depth
  information. On the other side, 3D-based approaches are more accurate but
  require more than one fixed camera to estimate depth information. In this
  paper, we describe a novel method for easy and precise calibration of a
  master-slave surveillance system, composed by a single fixed wide-angle
  camera. Our method exploits single view metrology to infer 3D data of the
  tracked humans and to selfperform the transformation between camera views.
  Experimental results in both simulated and realistic scenes point for the
  effectiveness of the proposed model in comparison with the state-of-the-art.
