abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to hand-based biometrics that
  uses mobile devices. Hand-based recognition has been explored via different
  research lines and taking into consideration different traits. On the other
  hand, few studies tackle its feasibility on mobile devices. Given their
  diffusion and availability, their use in this context appears particularly
  attractive. The work presented in this study aims at investigating at an high
  level the limitations of using hand geometry to enable biometric recognition
  on mobile. The first results obtained were encouraging let supposing potential
  margins of improvement of the proposed method.
