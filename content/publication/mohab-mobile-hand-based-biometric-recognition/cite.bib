abstract="This paper presents a novel approach to hand-based biometrics that uses mobile devices. Hand-based recognition has been explored via different research lines and taking into consideration different traits. On the other hand, few studies tackle its feasibility on mobile devices. Given their diffusion and availability, their use in this context appears particularly attractive. The work presented in this study aims at investigating at an high level the limitations of using hand geometry to enable biometric recognition on mobile. The first results obtained were encouraging let supposing potential margins of improvement of the proposed method.",
