abstract: One of the problems for archaeologic museums is having the opportunity
  to show most of the objects that they preserve. This is an action they can’t
  afford because of the limitation of exhibition spaces, the high number of
  artifacts they guard and/or the conditions of the real objects. Nowadays, with
  the use of cutting-edge 3D technologies, there is the possibility to offer
  virtual views of objects adding information and enhancing visitor’s
  experience. In this paper, an Augmented Reality app for visualizing restored
  ancient artifacts is presented. Based on an algorithm that addresses geometric
  constraints of fragments to re-build the object from parts, the AR application
  shows a reconstructed artifact offering the possibility for the user to
  visualize missing fragments. The app has been demonstrated using a real
  restored glass plate from the Manises Ceramic Museum, under the context of a
  research project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and
  Competitiveness.
