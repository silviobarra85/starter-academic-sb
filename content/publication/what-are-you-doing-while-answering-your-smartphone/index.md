abstract: "Context awareness is major component of Ambient Intelligence. In
  fact, Ambient Intelligent environments are designed to combine ubiquity,
  awareness, intelligence and natural interaction. Awareness is defined as the
  ability by the system to locate and recognize people and objects, and their
  intentions. Then, intelligence is the ability of the system to analyze the
  detected context and to adapt its behavior to people and situations, and to
  learn over time, in order to provide users with personalized services. These
  concepts date back to late'90, but nowadays the widespread and ubiquitous
  availability of mobile devices, equipped with several different sensors,
  allows to put them into practice in a number of unexpected ways. This work
  presents a preliminary investigation on the possibility to use some of the
  smartphone sensors, namely the accelerometer and the gyroscope, to identify
  the bodily context when the user lifts the device to answer a call. The arm
  gesture, i.e., the way it is performed, is classified into 4 different states:
  While standing, sitting, walking or running. This information can be used to
  trigger context-sensitive system actions."
