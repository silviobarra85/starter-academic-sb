abstract: Despite the success obtained in face detection and recognition over
  the last ten years of research, the analysis of facial attributes still
  represents a trend topic. Keeping the full face recognition aside, exploring
  the potentials of soft biometric traits, i.e. singular facial traits like the
  nose, the mouth, the hair and so on, is yet considered a fruitful field of
  investigation. Being able to infer the identity of an occluded face, e.g.
  voluntary occluded by sunglasses or accidentally due to environmental factors,
  can be useful in a wide range of operative fields where user collaboration
  cannot be considered as an assumption. This especially happens when dealing
  with forensic scenarios in which is not unusual to have partial face photos or
  partial fingerprints. In this paper, an unsupervised clustering approach is
  described. It consists in a neural network model for face attributes
  recognition based on transfer learning whose goal is grouping faces according
  to common facial features. Moreover, we use the features collected in each
  cluster to provide a compact and comprehensive description of the faces
  belonging to each cluster and deep learning as a mean for task prediction in
  partially visible faces.
