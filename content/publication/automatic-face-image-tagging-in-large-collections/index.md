abstract: In this chapter, the authors present some issues related to automatic
  face image tagging techniques. Their main purpose in user applications is to
  support the organization (indexing) and retrieval (or easy browsing) of images
  or videos in large collections. Their core modules include algorithms and
  strategies for handling very large face databases, mostly acquired in real
  conditions. As a background for understanding how automatic face tagging
  works, an overview about face recognition techniques is given, including both
  traditional approaches and novel proposed techniques for face recognition in
  uncontrolled settings. Moreover, some applications and the way they work are
  summarized, in order to depict the state of the art in this area of face
  recognition research. Actually, many of them are used to tag faces and to
  organize photo albums with respect to the person(s) presented in annotated
  photos. This kind of activity has recently expanded from personal devices to
  social networks, and can also significantly support more demanding tasks, such
  as automatic handling of large editorial collections for magazine publishing
  and archiving. Finally, a number of approaches to large-scale face datasets as
  well as some automatic face image tagging techniques are presented and
  compared. The authors show that many approaches, both in commercial and
  research applications, still provide only a semi-automatic solution for this
  problem.
