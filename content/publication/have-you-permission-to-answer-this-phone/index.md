abstract: The new frontier of biometrie authentication exploits wearable
  sensors. At present, there is no need of special equipment. Both cameras of
  increasing resolution, and MEMS-based sensors (Micro Electro-Mechanical
  Systems) are ubiquitously embedded in everyday mobile communication devices,
  especially smartphones. This makes their use economically attractive, and the
  investigation of the new provided possibilities increasingly widespread. The
  aim of the present paper is to demonstrate the possibility to control the
  access to a smartphone by recording and processing the dynamic signals
  produced by the simple gesture of lifting the phone, possibly in connection
  with further biometric information provided by ear recognition. In this
  respect, it continues and extends a previous work, by performing new
  experiments on a more challenging dataset.
