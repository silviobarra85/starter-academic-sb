abstract: Anastylosis is an archaeological technique which focuses on the
  reconstruction of collapsed building and destroyed artworks, starting from the
  original pieces. Many digital approaches have been developed in the last
  decade, mainly based on 2D and 3D analysis of the structure of the fragments.
  These techniques aim at supporting the priceless work of the involved
  operators, mainly in the decision processes and in the resolution of
  positioning ambiguities. Techniques acting with this scope lie in the field of
  the digital anastylosis. In this paper we present SAFFO, a digital approach to
  2D reconstruction of frescoes, based on the extraction of SIFT features from a
  painting. The approach appears to be very robust to false positives, resulting
  optimal in scenarios involving fragment sets containing spurious elements. The
  experiments have been performed on the DAFNE (Digital Anastylosis for Fresco
  challeNgE) dataset, which gathers more than 30 2D artworks and provides
  several tessellation for each. For its robustness against spurious fragments,
  SAFFO won the third place in the rank list of DAFNE Challenge 2019.
