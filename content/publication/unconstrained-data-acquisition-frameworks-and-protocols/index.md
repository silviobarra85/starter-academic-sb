abstract: The identification of humans in non-ideal conditions has been gaining
  increasing attention, mainly supported by the multitude of novel methods
  specifically developed to address the covariates of non-cooperative biometric
  recognition. Surveillance environments are one of the most representative
  cases of unconstrained scenarios, where fully automated human recognition has
  not been achieved, yet. These environments are particularly harsh for several
  reasons (e.g., high variations in illumination, pose, and expression), but the
  limited resolution of the biometric data acquired is regarded as the major
  factor for performance degradation. Consequently, different strategies for
  imaging subjects at-a-distance have been introduced. This chapter provides a
  comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art surveillance systems for
  acquiring biometric data at-a-distance in a non-cooperative manner. The
  challenges and the open issues of current architectures are highlighted. Also,
  the most promising strategies and future lines of research are outlined.
