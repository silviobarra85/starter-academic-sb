abstract: Tracking of human beings represents a hot research topic in the field
  of video analysis. It is attracting an increasing attention among researchers
  thanks to its possible application in many challenging tasks. Among these,
  action recognition, human/human and human/computer interaction require
  bodypart tracking. Most of the existing techniques in literature are
  model-based approaches, so despite their effectiveness, they are often unfit
  for the specific requirements of a body-part tracker. In this case it is very
  hard if not impossible to define a formal model of the target. This paper
  proposes a multi-anchor tracking system, which works on 8 bits color images
  and exploits the mutual information to track human body parts (head, hands,
  ...) without performing any foreground/background segmentation. The proposed
  method has been designed as a component of a more general system aimed at
  human interaction analysis. It has been tested on a wide set of color video
  sequences and the very promising results show its high potential.
